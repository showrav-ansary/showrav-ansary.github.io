            <p>There's a pretty much very good chance you have encountered me through a blog about algorithms.
                Well, I am not a competitive programmer but surely I do problem solving. 
                May be we can get in touch?

            <h2>Big Dream</h2>

            <h3>Become The Best Java Developer</h3>

            <p>
                I already know basics to multhreaded programming in Java. 
                I am also learning SpringBoot.
                But I know there's a long way to go. 
                The dream is to learn more and become the best!

            <p>
                I have been always been pro-active regarding learning new algorithms.
                May be it came from my curiosity about mathematics.
                Currently I happen to be an official <span class="green-highlight">Editorial Moderator</span>
                at <a href="https://lightoj.com/home">Light OJ</a>.
                Want to contribute <a href="https://github.com/lightoj-dev/problem-tutorials">Editorials</a>?

            <h2>Back End Java Developer</h2>
            <h3 class="green-highlight">2018 - Present</h3>

            <p>
                I have done a few projects academically and outside my academics using Jakarta stacks.
                I do not have the required skills of a front-end engineer but I can definitely help with back-end.
                My tech stack is Java, SpringBoot, MySQL/MS SQL Server and Apache Tomcat on a Linux server.
